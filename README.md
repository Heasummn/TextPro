# TextPro
A simple text editor, with some random features,
put together while going through [Data structures: Measuring and Optimizing Performance](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-structures-optimizing-performance/) on Coursera

## How it was put together
All of the front-end code was created by the kind people over at UC San Diego that created this course.

All of the back-end is done by me with major guidance from Christine Alvarado, Mia Minnes, and Leo Porter from UC San Diego.

## Layout
The different features of the app are organised by package depending on what they do. The front-end is all in the Application pacakge.
To understand the code, you should take the course, or have some understanding of using Data Structures in Java.

### Organization
The course guides you through building this application incrementally, so certain aspects of it are not used anymore, and we're just their
before we learnt about effecient ways to use them, such as the BasicDocument class. A great deal of the files are never used.

Some code is tested, whilst other code is not. This is because of the (sometimes) optional testing given by the course.


##Acknowledgements
A big thank you to Tomas Mikula for creating RichTextFX 
which was used as the text area in the GUI application.

Also a big thanks to everyone involved at UC San Diego for putting this and the course together
